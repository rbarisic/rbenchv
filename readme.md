___Mind your steps, this is a quick ( but effective ) hack.___

# rbenchv

Simple, automated benchmark to test several ruby versions.
Just configure the included 'run_rbenchv.sh' file to run all tests,
the results will be found in the 'rbenchv' subfolder.

### Troubleshooting

- If RVM can't find the ruby versions inside of run_rbenchv.sh, change them!
- The 'rbenchv'-subfolder has to exist, else the script will refuse to run.

------------------

### Now you're good to go.
Run home and create a benchmark, young yedi.
